Joe Biden (2021–Present)

Joseph Robinette Biden Jr., born in 1942 in Scranton, Pennsylvania, became the 46th President of the United States in January 2021. Before his presidency, he served as Vice President under Barack Obama (2009–2017) and spent over three decades representing Delaware in the U.S. Senate. Biden’s campaign emphasized unity, compassion, and the restoration of democratic norms following the divisive Trump era.

His presidency began during the COVID-19 pandemic, and his administration prioritized vaccine distribution and economic recovery through the American Rescue Plan. Biden also launched ambitious infrastructure and climate initiatives, including the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act and the Inflation Reduction Act, focusing on clean energy and job creation.

In foreign policy, Biden sought to rebuild alliances strained under his predecessor, rejoined the Paris Climate Agreement, and supported Ukraine in its war against Russia through extensive military and financial aid. However, his administration faced criticism over the chaotic withdrawal from Afghanistan in 2021 and challenges like inflation and immigration. Despite these obstacles, Biden’s leadership style emphasizes empathy, moderation, and a return to stability after years of political turbulence.
