Bill Clinton (1993–2001)

William Jefferson Clinton, born in 1946 in Hope, Arkansas, served as the 42nd President of the United States. A skilled communicator and centrist Democrat, Clinton sought to modernize liberalism through his “Third Way” politics — blending fiscal responsibility with social progress.

During his presidency, the United States experienced one of its longest periods of peacetime economic expansion. His administration achieved a balanced federal budget, reduced national debt, and oversaw the creation of millions of new jobs. Clinton also signed the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), promoting trade among the U.S., Canada, and Mexico. His domestic policies focused on education, welfare reform, and crime reduction, while his foreign policy emphasized globalization and diplomacy.

However, Clinton’s presidency was overshadowed by personal scandal. His affair with White House intern Monica Lewinsky led to impeachment by the House of Representatives in 1998 on charges of perjury and obstruction of justice, though he was acquitted by the Senate and completed his term with high approval ratings.

Despite controversies, Clinton left office with a strong economy and significant influence on modern Democratic politics. His ability to connect with ordinary Americans and his pragmatic governance helped shape U.S. policy well into the 21st century.
