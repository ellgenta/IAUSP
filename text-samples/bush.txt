George W. Bush (2001–2009)

George Walker Bush, born in 1946 in New Haven, Connecticut, served as the 43rd President of the United States. The son of former President George H. W. Bush, he entered office after a disputed 2000 election against Al Gore. His presidency was quickly defined by the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks, which reshaped American foreign and domestic policy for decades.

In response, Bush launched the War on Terror, invading Afghanistan in 2001 to dismantle al-Qaeda and later Iraq in 2003, under claims that Saddam Hussein possessed weapons of mass destruction. These conflicts, especially the Iraq War, became highly controversial, with long-term human and economic costs. Domestically, Bush established the Department of Homeland Security and implemented the USA PATRIOT Act to strengthen national security.

His administration also enacted major education reform through the No Child Left Behind Act and introduced tax cuts aimed at stimulating economic growth. However, his second term was marred by criticism over the federal response to Hurricane Katrina in 2005 and the global financial crisis of 2008. Despite mixed opinions, Bush’s presidency profoundly influenced U.S. foreign policy and the nation’s approach to terrorism and global leadership.
