Donald John Trump, born in 1946 in Queens, New York, was the 45th President of the United States and one of the most controversial figures in modern American politics. Before entering politics, he was a real estate mogul and television personality, best known for The Apprentice. Running as a Republican outsider, Trump’s 2016 campaign capitalized on populist anger, economic frustration, and distrust in the political establishment. His slogan, “Make America Great Again,” became a defining symbol of his movement.

During his presidency, Trump enacted significant tax cuts through the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, deregulated industries, and appointed three conservative justices to the U.S. Supreme Court, reshaping its ideological balance. His administration emphasized “America First,” withdrawing from international agreements like the Paris Climate Accord and the Iran Nuclear Deal.

However, his presidency was marred by controversy, including two impeachments, widespread criticism of his handling of the COVID-19 pandemic, and accusations of inciting the January 6, 2021, Capitol riot. Supporters praised his economic growth and nationalist policies, while critics condemned his divisive rhetoric and disregard for democratic norms. Trump’s legacy remains deeply polarizing, representing both populist resurgence and unprecedented political upheaval.
