The History of the Second World War

The history of the Second World War is one of the darkest yet most defining moments in human history. It began in 1939 and ended in 1945, changing the world forever. Nations fought across the land, sea, and sky, and millions lost their lives in the global fight for power and peace. The war created destruction but also innovation. It united some parts of the world while dividing others. From this great war, humanity learned how fragile peace can be and how strong people can become in times of chaos. History still remembers the war as a warning and a lesson for the world.
